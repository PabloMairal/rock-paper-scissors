Hey! this is (for now) a simple, console game of rock/paper/scissors.

I got carried away and make it in one go without commits after finishing parts of my code that were already working, which it's far from ideal and I'm going to pay more attention to. Light can go out you know? It's scary to lose parts of your code.
