Hey! this is (for now) a simple, console game of rock/paper/scissors. I used JavaScript to make it. I'm pretty sure there are ways to code it that are shorter or more efficient, but I'm pretty happy that I make it work in less than 2 hours. Fun stuff!

It's fair to say that I have previous experience with coding(C++), I study programming in highschool 7 years ago. Life took me places... And this is the first time since then that I code again. It's good to be back.

I got carried away and make it in one go without commits after finishing parts of my code that were already working, which it's far from ideal and I'm going to pay more attention to. Light can go out you know? It's scary to lose parts of your code.
